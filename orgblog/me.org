* How do you buy food and shelter?
  I'm a PhD candidate at Oregon State University.

* What have you been up to?
  Finishing that damned PhD, hacking [[https://github.com/LeventErkok/sbv][sbv]] or [[https://github.com/doyougnu][vsat/vsmt]] or likely programming
  something....

* How to contact you?
  jeff@doyougnu.xyz

* Why "doyougnu" for everything online?
  My legal name =Jeffrey M. Young= is extremely common, so I resort to a
  pseudonym.
