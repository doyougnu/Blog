* To Deploy
** Source code highlighting
   You have to run ~doyougnu/publish~ in an ~ielm~ repl or else the fonts won't
load

** Build the site
   This will rebuild the =public_html= directory. This will not apply syntax
   highlighting to the source code blocks though

   #+begin_src
   emacs -q --script publish.el -f doyougnu/publish
   #+end_src

** Deploy to remote
deployment is done via github actions. This is very hacky but for our needs it
works well. Read through ~.github/workflows/deploy.yml~ for a precise description.
We simply use an ubuntu container, install emacs, and run the ~publish.el~ script
