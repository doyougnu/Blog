### Hello
My name is Jeffrey Young I am currently a Computer Science PhD student working
under [Eric Walkingshaw](http://web.engr.oregonstate .edu/~walkiner/) at [Oregon
State University](http://oregonstate.edu/). I enjoy working out, ultimate
frisbee, playing dungeons and dragons 5th edition, and of course programming.

### Purpose

This is my personal blog it serves a few purposes:

1. Practice Writing
2. A platform to rant about graduate school and research
3. It is genuinely enjoyable to put thoughts down on paper

### Research Interests
I have a strong research interest in functional programming, type theory and
systems, category theory and philosophy of mathematics. The main focus of my PhD
work has been on the intersection variational programming and satisfiability
solvers to tackle difficult problems in software product lines.

### Contact
You can email me at **youngjef@oregonstate.edu** other than that you can find me
at the usual places online. I don't frequent social media much because I think
it is unhealthy to me and society as a whole. In any case, here you go:

- [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-young-17b97566/) although it is quite out of date
